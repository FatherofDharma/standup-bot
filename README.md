## _Description_

This bot will post a message into a specefic discord channel, and send one DM, a few minutes before 10:00 AM and 1:30 PM. It will also constantly update the bot's status with a countdown to the next standup time.

## _Setup/Installation Requirements_

* _Clone this repo_
* _Run the command `npm i` from the root directory to install the dependancies._
* _To use this bot you'll need to get a `token` from discord by registering your own bot, and add it to an `.env` file. You'll also need to change the channel and user it messages. I'd recommend using the [discord.js instructions on how to setup and register a bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/)._
